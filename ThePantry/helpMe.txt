Your project structure follows a typical pattern where responsibilities are separated into models, repositories, services, and data management.
 Here's how the Repository, UnitOfWork, and SqlPantryDatabase components will work together in your application:

Flow of Operations:

    Repositories Handle Data Access:
        The service layer or controllers will call the repository methods (e.g., GetAllIngredients() in the IngredientRepository) to interact with the database.
        The repository methods use the DB helper class to execute SQL commands and retrieve data.

    UnitOfWork Manages Transactions:
        The service layer will use the UnitOfWork to manage repositories. For example, if a recipe is added and associated measurements need to be added as well, 
        the UnitOfWork coordinates these operations.
        Once all changes (across multiple repositories) are prepared, UnitOfWork.Commit() will save everything in a single database transaction.

    SqlPantryDatabase Initializes Tables:
        When your application starts, SqlPantryDatabase.CreateAllTables() is called to ensure that the necessary tables exist in the database.

How it Works in Your Application:

    Repository Layer: Direct access to the database (CRUD operations).
    UnitOfWork Layer: Transaction management and coordination across multiple repositories.
    SqlPantryDatabase: Database initialization and table creation.

This architecture ensures separation of concerns, making your code more modular and easier to maintain. By leveraging these design patterns, 
you ensure better transaction control, easier testing, and more flexible data access.

 Flow of Operations in a WebAPI

Here’s how the flow typically works:

    Controller receives an HTTP request (e.g., POST /api/recipes to add a recipe).
    The controller calls the appropriate Service method (e.g., RecipeService.AddRecipe()), passing in the necessary data.
    Service applies business logic, validates the data, converts DTOs if needed, and calls the UnitOfWork or individual Repositories to interact with the database.
    Repository performs the database operation (e.g., insert the new recipe).
    Service returns a result to the Controller, which then sends an HTTP response back to the client.

5. Why Keep the Service Layer?

Even after adding controllers in your WebAPI, the service layer is important for the following reasons:

    Separation of Concerns: It separates business logic from data access and presentation. Controllers should focus on handling requests,
     and repositories should focus on interacting with the database. Services are where the "logic" of your application lives.
    Reusability: If your business logic lives in services, you can reuse it across different parts of your application (e.g., web, mobile, background tasks).
    Testability: It makes your code easier to test. You can mock the service layer during unit testing for your controllers and mock the
     repository layer for testing your services.

Conclusion

In summary, the Services folder is a critical part of your architecture. It provides a layer of abstraction between the controllers 
and the repositories, making your code more modular, maintainable, and testable. Even after turning your application into a WebAPI, 
the service layer should remain in place to handle the business logic.

Your project will follow this structure:

    Controller → Service → UnitOfWork/Repositories → Database.
