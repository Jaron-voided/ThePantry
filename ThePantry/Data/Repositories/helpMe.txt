Repositories act as intermediaries between the data access layer and the rest of your application, providing an abstraction over database operations.
 Each repository will be responsible for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for a specific model (e.g., Recipe, Ingredient, Measurement).

    Repositories Folder: This folder contains individual repository classes like RecipeRepository, IngredientRepository, and MeasurementRepository.
        IngredientRepository: Handles database operations related to Ingredients, such as fetching, adding, updating, and deleting ingredients.
        RecipeRepository: Handles database operations related to Recipes.
        MeasurementRepository: Manages database operations for Measurements.

Each repository will interact directly with the DB helper class (or ADO.NET) to execute SQL commands.
