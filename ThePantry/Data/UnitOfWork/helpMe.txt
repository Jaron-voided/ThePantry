The UnitOfWork pattern helps to manage transactions and coordination across multiple repositories. 
It ensures that all operations across repositories can be committed as a single transaction, reducing the risk of inconsistencies.

    UnitOfWork Interface:
        It exposes properties for each repository (IIngredientRepository, IRecipeRepository, IMeasurementRepository).
        It has a Commit() method that ensures all the changes made within a transaction are saved to the database at once.
    UnitOfWork Class: Implements the IUnitOfWork interface, ensuring that when Commit is called, it commits all changes made to the repositories.
