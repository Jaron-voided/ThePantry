1. Start with Models

    Why: The models represent the core data of your application. These are the entities that will be stored in the database and will be the foundation for other layers.

    Concrete classes: Start by defining your models (Ingredient, Measurement, Recipe) based on the interfaces you’ve already created. Make sure to include constructors, properties, and basic validation if needed.

    Steps:
        Write the concrete implementations of the models (Ingredient, Measurement, Recipe) based on their interfaces.
        Ensure the relationships between the models (e.g., Measurement references Ingredient and Recipe by ID) are implemented properly.

2. DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)

    Why: DTOs are used to transfer data between layers, especially between the service and presentation layers (e.g., controllers). These should be simple, containing only the fields necessary for data transfer.

    Concrete classes: Create the concrete classes for the DTOs (IngredientDTO, MeasurementDTO, RecipeDTO).

    Steps:
        Implement any necessary constructors and transformation logic (e.g., mapping between models and DTOs in the service layer).
        Focus on keeping DTOs lightweight and focused on the specific data needed by the client.

3. Repositories

    Why: Repositories are responsible for data access (CRUD operations). You’ll need to ensure the repositories can perform operations on the database using the models.

    Concrete classes: Implement the repository concrete classes (IngredientRepository, RecipeRepository, MeasurementRepository).

    Steps:
        Start with the basic CRUD operations (Add, Update, Delete, GetById, GetAll).
        Implement more specific operations as defined in your interfaces (e.g., GetAllMeasurementsForRecipe()).
        Ensure you use the UnitOfWork pattern to manage transactions across repositories.

4. Services

    Why: Services contain business logic and orchestrate calls to the repositories. They also handle more complex operations that involve multiple repositories or applying business rules.

    Concrete classes: Implement the service layer classes (IngredientService, RecipeService, MeasurementService).

    Steps:
        Write logic for methods like PricePerPortion, CalculateTotalPriceForRecipe, and other business-related calculations.
        Implement DTO transformation methods (e.g., MapToDTO, MapToIngredient).
        Ensure the service layer is interacting with the repositories in a clean, decoupled way.

5. UnitOfWork

    Why: UnitOfWork helps group multiple operations that need to happen in a single transaction (e.g., saving a recipe and its associated measurements).

    Concrete class: Implement UnitOfWork and ensure it handles committing all repository changes within a single transaction.

    Steps:
        Ensure UnitOfWork correctly manages the repositories (Ingredients, Recipes, Measurements).
        Implement the Commit method to handle saving changes across multiple repositories.

6. Controllers

    Why: Controllers handle HTTP requests in the WebAPI. They should delegate work to the services and return the appropriate response to the client.

    Concrete classes: Implement the controllers (IngredientsController, RecipesController, MeasurementsController).

    Steps:
        Use the services to handle requests in the controllers.
        Implement CRUD endpoints for managing ingredients, recipes, and measurements.
        Make sure the controller is lightweight and focuses on handling the HTTP layer.

Summary of the Sequence:

    Models: Concrete models based on your interfaces.
    DTOs: Lightweight objects for transferring data between layers.
    Repositories: Data access layer for CRUD operations.
    Services: Business logic and orchestration of operations.
    UnitOfWork: Managing transactions across repositories.
    Controllers: Exposing the functionality via API endpoints.

This approach builds up from the core models and database interaction to the API and business logic, ensuring everything is layered and structured properly.
